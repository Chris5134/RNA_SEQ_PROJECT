This project re-analyzes the GSE294133 mouse hippocampus RNA-Seq dataset (5×FAD vs. 5×FAD\_CLU) to identify sex-specific and overall differential gene expression. It uses DESeq2 to normalize counts, filter low-abundance genes, and test genotype effects both across all samples and within male and female subsets. The workflow generates PCA and volcano plots, applies fold-change and adjusted p-value cutoffs to define significant genes, and performs Gene Ontology enrichment to highlight the top biological processes altered by CLU status.
